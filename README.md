# Distributed-Components


This repository includes distributed components used for the implementation of distributed algorithms.
The components are developed upon existing maven projects.


<b>1. Eventually Perfect Failure Detector</b>

<b>2. Basic, Eager Reliable and Waiting-Causal Broadcast</b>

Path: id2203-ass2-broadcast/src/main/java/se/kth/ict/id2203/components

<b>3. Shared Memory -  Read-Impose Write-Consult algorithm</b>

Path: id2203-ass3-shm/src/main/java/se/kth/ict/id2203/components/riwcm

<b>4. Consensus  Paxos Algorithm</b>

Path: id2203-ass4-consensus/src/main/java/se/kth/ict/id2203/components/paxos

<b>5. Total Order Broadcast - Multipaxos Algorithm</b>

Path: id2203-ass5-tob/src/main/java/se/kth/ict/id2203/components/multipaxos



<i>The algorithms were implemented for the purposes of the ID2204-Advanced Topics in Distributed Systems course.</i>

<i>The Kompics framework was used: http://kompics.sics.se/</i>
